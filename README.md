Map of Computing
================

A knowlege base with intesting links and ideas about the disaplin of Computing.

This was originaly created as a personal knoelege base but hope it will become a tool to document cool computing stuff for learners.

Many of the links have come from exiting articles from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

This knowlege base is plain markdown with tags/links.
It is hoped that this could be tidyed and visible as a web wiki/page/online-book at somepoint.
